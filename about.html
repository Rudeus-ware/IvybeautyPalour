        <h2>Where It All Began </h2>
        <p  >
            Founded in 2010 by renowned stylist Ava Sinclair, Ivy Beauty Parlor started as a small boutique salon with a big dream: to redefine beauty standards and create a sanctuary where clients could indulge in self-care. Ava's vision was clear—to blend luxury with accessibility, ensuring everyone could experience top-tier beauty services without the hefty price tag.
        </p>
        <p>Ivy wasn't just creating hairstyles; she was building a sanctuary. After 15 years in high-end salons where clients felt like numbers, she dreamed of a place that felt like a trusted friend's living room—a place for genuine connection, expert craft, and results that made you feel like the best version of yourself.</p>

        <h2>The Seed of an Idea: Why "Ivy"?</h2>
        <p>
People often ask about our name. For Ivy Monroe, ivy represented resilience, natural beauty, and graceful growth. "Ivy clings to walls and climbs heights not with force, but with patient, steady tenacity," she'd say. "It transforms ordinary spaces into living art. That’s what I wanted for our clients—to help them uncover their own enduring beauty, one strand, one glow, at a time."</p>
        <p>Word spread quickly. What started as a one-woman studio became a collective of like-minded artists. By 2012, we moved to our current, light-filled location. We added skincare in 2014, recognizing that true radiance starts with healthy skin. Our nail studio, launched in 2017, completed our vision of a holistic beauty home.

Every expansion was guided by our founding principle: Quality Over Quantity, Relationship Over Transaction.</p>
